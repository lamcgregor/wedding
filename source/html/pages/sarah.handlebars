<p>
We all have those stories from childhood that become part of us – that shape who we are and remain precious to us for our entire life. Today I will share with you a story like this – a story without which I would not be who I am today. And I’m not even talking about Harry Potter this time. The tale I’m going to tell concerns a magical warrior princess named Pegasus.
</p>
<p>
Like her namesake, Pegasus was a beautiful and powerful being, as fierce as she was fair. When Pegasus put her mind to something, trees bent, waters receded, winds changed, parents conceded and siblings scattered before her. Tales of her strength and determination spread like wildfire. Indeed, it was said that Pegasus’ mind was so bright and her inner fire so strong that it once set her hair aflame. The fire burnt atop Pegasus’ head for years, and still her hair is stained dark red from the blaze. Travellers whispered over campfires of Pegasus’ single mindedness. So heedless was she of the trifling obstacles of the mortal world that, it was told, she would often fly straight into such things – like the sides of swimming pools, and corners of buildings. The fearless warrior princess explored and conquered the world –Canada, Greece, Barbados, the vast and treacherous Puberty jungle, the gloomy caverns of the Emo-stage. She narrowly escaped the Venetian curse of ‘Broke-and-missed-the-flight-home’ and conquered the infamous Wall of Death on the icy slopes of Austria.

Somewhere along her wondrous adventures, Pegasus met a quest companion with whom she journeyed for ever after. One day, whilst travelling through the forest on her mighty cat steed, Pegasus came across a handsome young prince attempting to single-handedly fight off a battalion of evil henchmen. After a spectacular CO-OP battle, the two sat on their pile of treasure and XP points and talked. Pegasus and Prince Lukewarm, for that was his name, quickly discovered a lot about each other and became very fond of what they found. Despite his cunning soft indie disguise, Prince Lukewarm was revealed to be just as worthy a warrior as Pegasus, as well as being young, light and far more than just lukewarm of heart. Most importantly, Pegasus found to her delight that the prince had incredible taste in video games and knitted sweaters.
</p>
<p>
Pegasus’ loyal guards, Donag and Sarag, tested the prince’s worth with a series of trials, including verbal abuse, psychological warfare, and snack and clothing burglary. Yet the prince proved himself again and again, and the two adventurers soon became inseparable.  The tales of Pegasus became the tales of Pegasus and Prince Lukewarm. One of their first epics, the Chronicles of Asia, can be found in full on their travel blog, theadventuresofpeggyandluke.com. The entries tell of how Pegasus and Prince Lukewarm boldly explore the unknown and mysterious as well as the guide-recommended, and fearlessly conquer the heat, the scams and the strain of being around one person non-stop for months. In fact, it was the latter of these triumphs that helped Pegasus and Prince Lukewarm realise that they really had found their true adventure companion. Henceforth, no challenge proved too perilous, no mission beyond their strength – for each had their CO-OP buddy for life.
</p>
<p>
As it may be obvious (perhaps a little too obvious), I am far more at home in the realm of games, stories and fantasy than in real-life relationships and events, which seem to me to be rather tedious and every-day, yet  far more tiring and frightening, in comparison. With Peggy and Luke, however, I have never once felt this. Peggy and Luke have somehow merged the best bits of the imaginary and the real, of the fantastic and the every-day. Together they stay young without resisting change. They dream whilst relishing what they have. They play as hard as they work (I can attest to this after seeing them while focused and also witnessing one of their legendary nerf-gun fights). It’s not just their adventurous travels that are worthy of telling and appreciating, but all the bits in between. Like a Tolkien tale, the rests, feasts, casual conversations and little experiences hold just as much value as the great battles and far-off journeys. I love going to stay with Peg and Luke because for a while, I get to be right in the middle of that warm, happy place that they inhabit together. I get to see them get up and rush for work, always still making sure that they time it so they can get ready and leave together. I get to be there when they come home and collapse on the couch, play with the cat, put on a show, read quietly together, make tea for each other (with totally equal turns, I’m told, though I suspect Pegasus still sometimes uses her mind-control powers to maintain this façade). Even when they compromise my carefully planned stealth mission by bursting into the game-room playing ‘Never Gonna Give You Up’ by Rick Astley, and dancing around me like dorky indie robots - even then, I can’t help but think ‘Wow, they’ve got it right’, ‘Wow, they’re lucky’ and ‘Wow, I’m lucky to be a part of it’.
</p>
<p>
Luke and Peggy are both an awaited adventure and a well-deserved rest. They are night and day, fantastic and familiar, work and play, childlike in glee and mature when it counts - the best of all worlds. They make the real-world look not so bad.
</p>
<p>
My big sister, who gave me all her old clothes and CDS, showed me books, movies and music, set trends, set an example, always had the coolest hair colours (USED to have the coolest hair colours). My big sister, who spent lazy Sundays watching the OC with me, worships Pride & Prejudice with me, learned all the songs from Moulin Rouge with me (and remains ready to perform these with me at any given time and place with no pre-warning). The Elizabeth Bennett to my best bits of Mary and Lydia Bennett - I could not have parted with you, my dear, for anyone less worthy. (Although it’s not too late if you want me to call Darcy or Justin Trudeau). Luke – thank you for giving her what she deserves. Thank you for being her best-friend.
</p>
<p>
And so, in-keeping with the unavoidable theme that has dominated this speech due to my chronic dorkiness, I’ll conclude by channelling Tolkien or, more specifically, Bilbo, and predict that the ending for the tales of Pegasus and Prince Lukewarm, though far, far in the future yet, will be along the lines of ‘and they lived happily ever after to the end of their days’.
