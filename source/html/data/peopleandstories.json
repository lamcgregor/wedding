She taught me my first dance moves when I was 11, so if you see us doing something weird with our shoulders to a Hanson song, that’s why. Formally known as ‘the cousin who cried England’, Ros is finally making true on her promise to visit, and I’m so chuffed that she can be one of my bridesmaids.",
